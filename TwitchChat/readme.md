# Twitch Chat
Are you a streamer and do you want to add the twitch chat as an overlay to your game of Clone Hero?
Maybe you want to have it as close as possible to read it easily?
Whatever the case may be, you can use this tweak to do just that!
By pressing Ctrl + Shift + F10 (Can be customized), you can bring up the config window.

## How to install
- You will need Clone Hero **v0.23.2.2**.
- Make sure you install CHLauncher first!
  - Navigate to the `#ch-launcher` channel, and download the latest version of CHLauncher.exe.
  - Run it, and patch your version of Clone Hero with it. You should now have a `Tweaks` folder in your Clone Hero folder.
- Download the latest version of `PerfectMode.dll` from [the releases page](https://github.com/joosthoi1/Joost-tweaks/releases) and place it in your tweaks folder.

## how to use
Simply open up the config menu (Ctrl + Shift + F10 by default) enter your channel name and check enable.
You can save these settings so you don't have to enter it in each time (recommended) simply scroll to the bottom and press the save button.

# NOTICE
A small oversight I made makes it so you have to enter the channel in lowercase letters ONLY.
This requirement will be patched out in the next version.
